            India offers a diverse range of travel experiences, from historical
            sites like the Taj Mahal to stunning natural landscapes like the
            Himalayas. For a memorable trip, consider exploring the Golden
            Triangle (Delhi, Agra, Jaipur), visiting hill stations, or exploring
            the beaches and backwaters of South India. Remember to plan your
            trip based on the season, as India experiences various weather
            patterns.

          <h2 class="subheading">Indian Music</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            Indian music uses just-intonation tuning, unlike some modern Western
            classical music, which uses the equal-temperament tuning system.
            Also, unlike modern Western classical music, Indian classical music
            places great emphasis on improvisation. Indian music is increasingly
            popular globally. A survey ranked India 20th for global music
            influence and 6th for uniqueness. Global consumption of Indian music
            has seen a significant jump, with a 2000% increase in the last five
            years. This growth is particularly noticeable in countries like
            Turkiye, Brazil, and Italy.
